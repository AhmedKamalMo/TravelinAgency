# üñºÔ∏è Quick Fix: Upload Images to GoDaddy

## ‚ùå Current Problem
Images are not showing on your website because you only uploaded the source code (via `git clone`), not the built files with images.

---

## ‚úÖ Solution in 3 Steps

### Step 1: Build Locally
```powershell
# Run this on your Windows computer
npm run generate
.\build-for-godaddy.ps1
```

This creates `godaddy-ready/` folder with ALL files including 150+ images.

---

### Step 2: Upload to GoDaddy

#### Using File Manager (Easiest):
1. Login to GoDaddy cPanel
2. Go to File Manager
3. Navigate to `public_html/`
4. **Delete all files** (keep `cgi-bin` if exists)
5. Click "Upload"
6. Select ALL files from `godaddy-ready/` folder
7. Wait for upload to complete (may take 5-10 minutes due to images)

#### Important Files to Verify Uploaded:
- ‚úÖ `.htaccess`
- ‚úÖ `images/` folder (entire folder with 150+ images)
- ‚úÖ `api-handler.php`
- ‚úÖ All HTML files

### Step 3: Test Images

Visit these URLs to verify images are working:

1. **Logo:** https://worldtripagency.com/images/home/logo/WonderlandLogo.svg
2. **Package Image:** https://worldtripagency.com/images/packages/imported/package-5.jpeg
3. **Barcelona:** https://worldtripagency.com/images/destinations/global/Barcelona/Barcelona1.jpeg

All should load without 404 errors!

## üö® If Images Still Don't Show

1. **Clear browser cache:** Press `Ctrl+Shift+Delete` and clear cache
2. **Check file permissions on GoDaddy:**
   ```bash
   cd public_html
   chmod -R 755 images/
   ```
3. **Verify images folder exists:**
   ```bash
   ls -la images/
   ```

---

## üìä What Gets Uploaded

Your `godaddy-ready/` folder contains:
- **150+ image files** in `images/` folder
- All HTML pages
- JavaScript and CSS files
- Complete API handler
- Database files

Total size: ~100-150 MB

---

## ‚ö° Alternative: Use SSH/FTP

If File Manager is slow, use FTP client (FileZilla):
1. Connect to your GoDaddy FTP
2. Navigate to `public_html/`
3. Delete all files
4. Upload all files from `godaddy-ready/`

**Remember:** The `.output/public/` folder (which contains all images) is generated by the build process and is NOT in Git. You must upload the built files, not clone from Git on the server!
