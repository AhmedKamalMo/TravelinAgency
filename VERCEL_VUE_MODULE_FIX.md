# Vercel Vue Module Fix - Root Cause Found and Resolved

## 🎯 Root Cause Identified
The crash was **NOT** caused by SSR or API calls. The real issue was:

```
Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find package 'vue' imported from /var/task/index.mjs
```

**Vue.js was missing from the dependencies** in `package.json`, causing the deployment to fail.

## 🔧 The Fix Applied

### 1. Added Vue to Dependencies
**File**: `package.json`
```json
"dependencies": {
  // ... other dependencies
  "vue": "^3.5.0",  // ← Added this line
  "vue-chartjs": "^5.3.2",
  "vue-i18n": "^9.9.0",
  // ... rest of dependencies
}
```

### 2. Reverted SSR Changes
**File**: `pages/index.vue`
- Removed `ssr: false` since the issue wasn't SSR-related
- Restored normal SSR functionality

## 🚀 Deploy the Fix

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Vue module not found error by adding Vue to dependencies"
git push origin main
```

## ✅ Expected Results

After deployment, your website should:
- ✅ **Load successfully** at `https://worldtripagency.com/`
- ✅ **Display all sections** (hero, services, destinations, packages)
- ✅ **Work with SSR** (server-side rendering)
- ✅ **No more module errors** in Vercel logs

## 🔍 What This Fixes

### Before (Broken):
- `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND: Cannot find package 'vue'`
- All pages returning 500 errors
- Deployment completely broken

### After (Fixed):
- Vue.js properly installed and available
- All pages load correctly
- SSR works as expected
- Full functionality restored

## 📋 Why This Happened

1. **Missing Dependency**: Vue.js wasn't listed in `package.json` dependencies
2. **Build Process**: Vercel couldn't find Vue during the build/deployment
3. **Runtime Error**: When the app tried to import Vue, it failed with module not found

## 🧪 Test Pages Status

The test pages I created are still available for testing:
- `/test-minimal` - Minimal test page
- `/test-simple` - Simple test with layout
- `/` - Main page (should now work)

## 🔄 All Previous Fixes Still Apply

The SSR fixes I made earlier are still valid and will prevent future issues:
- ✅ `usePackages` composable - Fixed SSR API calls
- ✅ Maintenance middleware - Added server-side check
- ✅ Admin middleware - Added server-side check

## 🎉 Summary

**The main issue was a missing Vue dependency, not SSR problems.** Once Vue is properly installed, the website should work perfectly with all the SSR optimizations in place.

**Deploy the fix and your website should be fully functional!** 🚀
