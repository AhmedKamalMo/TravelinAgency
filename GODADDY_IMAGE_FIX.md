# 🖼️ Fix Images on GoDaddy - Complete Guide

## Problem
Images are not showing on the GoDaddy website because the **built files** weren't uploaded. When you use `git clone`, it only downloads the source code, not the generated `.output` folder.

## Solution: Upload Built Files with Images

### ⚠️ Important
The `.output/public/` folder contains ALL the images and built website files. This folder is generated by `npm run generate` and is NOT in the Git repository.

---

## 🔧 Step 1: Build the Project Locally

Run this in your local Windows computer:

```powershell
# Make sure you're in the project directory
cd F:\TravelinAgency

# Build the project (this generates .output/public/ with all images)
npm run generate
```

This will create `.output/public/` with:
- All HTML files
- All images from `public/images/`
- All JavaScript and CSS files
- Everything ready for deployment

---

## 📦 Step 2: Prepare Deployment Package

Run the PowerShell script to create a deployment-ready folder:

```powershell
.\build-for-godaddy.ps1
```

This creates the `godaddy-ready/` folder with everything you need to upload.

## 🚀 Step 3: Deploy to GoDaddy

### Option A: Using File Manager (Recommended)

1. **Login to GoDaddy cPanel**
   - Go to your GoDaddy hosting cPanel

2. **Go to File Manager**
   - Navigate to `public_html/`

3. **Delete Old Files**
   - Select all files/folders in `public_html/`
   - Delete them (EXCEPT `cgi-bin` if it exists)

4. **Upload New Files**
   - Click "Upload"
   - Select ALL files from `godaddy-ready/` folder
   - Wait for upload to complete (this may take time due to images)

5. **Verify Images Folder**
   - Make sure `public_html/images/` exists
   - Check that it contains:
     - `home/logo/WonderlandLogo.svg`
     - `destinations/global/Barcelona/Barcelona1.jpeg`
     - `packages/imported/package-5.jpeg`

### Option B: Using FTP

1. **Connect via FTP**
   - Host: Your GoDaddy FTP hostname
   - Username: Your FTP username
   - Password: Your FTP password

2. **Navigate to public_html/**

3. **Delete all files** (except cgi-bin)

4. **Upload all files from godaddy-ready/**
   - Make sure to upload recursively (including subdirectories)
   - Wait for all images to upload

## 📋 Step 4: Update API Handler

Before testing, make sure `api-handler.php` has your correct database credentials:

```php
$host = 'localhost';
$dbname = 'travel';
$username = 'travel';
$password = 'support@Passord123';
```

Replace `api-handler.php` on GoDaddy with `api-handler-complete.php` from `godaddy-ready/`:

```bash
# In GoDaddy terminal:
cd public_html
cp api-handler-complete.php api-handler.php
```

---

## ✅ Step 5: Verify Images

Test these URLs in your browser:

1. **Logo:**
   ```
   https://worldtripagency.com/images/home/logo/WonderlandLogo.svg
   ```

2. **Destination Image:**
   ```
   https://worldtripagency.com/images/destinations/global/Barcelona/Barcelona1.jpeg
   ```

3. **Package Image:**
   ```
   https://worldtripagency.com/images/packages/imported/package-5.jpeg
   ```

All should load without 404 errors.

---

## 🧪 Step 6: Test Website

Visit these pages and verify images are showing:

1. **Homepage:**
   ```
   https://worldtripagency.com/
   ```
   - Check logo in header
   - Check hero images
   - Check service images

2. **Packages Page:**
   ```
   https://worldtripagency.com/packages/
   ```
   - Check package card images

3. **About Page:**
   ```
   https://worldtripagency.com/about/
   ```
   - Check hero background

---

## 📊 Image Statistics

Your website has:
- **96** package images
- **45** destination images
- **16** home page images
- **Logo and icons**

Total: ~150+ image files that need to be uploaded!

## 🚨 Common Issues

### Issue 1: Images still 404 after upload
**Solution:** Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)

### Issue 2: Some images work, others don't
**Solution:** Check file permissions on GoDaddy:
```bash
cd public_html
chmod -R 755 images/
```

### Issue 3: Upload takes forever
**Solution:** Use FTP instead of File Manager, or upload in smaller batches

## 🎯 Quick Command Reference

### Local (Windows PowerShell):
```powershell
# Build project
npm run generate

# Prepare deployment
.\build-for-godaddy.ps1
```

### GoDaddy Terminal (SSH):
```bash
# Check images folder exists
ls -la public_html/images/

# Check specific image
ls -la public_html/images/home/logo/WonderlandLogo.svg

# Fix permissions if needed
chmod -R 755 public_html/images/
```

---

## ⚡ Alternative: Use rsync (Advanced)

If you have SSH access to GoDaddy:

```bash
# From local terminal (Git Bash on Windows)
rsync -avz --delete .output/public/ username@server:/home/username/public_html/
```

This is faster and only uploads changed files.

---

## 🎉 Success!

Once all images are uploaded, your website should display all images correctly without any 404 errors.

**Remember:** Every time you make changes locally and rebuild, you need to upload the updated files to GoDaddy!
