## 🔧 Deployment Steps on GoDaddy Server

### Step 1: Pull Latest Changes
```bash
# In your SSH session on GoDaddy:
cd public_html
git pull origin main
```

### Step 2: Test the Working File First
```bash
# Visit in browser: https://worldtripagency.com/index-working.php
# This should show a working PHP page with database connection
```

### Step 3: Replace Main Files (if test works)
```bash
# Backup current files
mv index.php index-broken.php
mv api-handler.php api-handler-broken.php
mv .htaccess .htaccess-broken

# Replace with clean files
mv index-clean.php index.php
mv api-simple.php api-handler.php
mv .htaccess-clean .htaccess

# Set proper permissions
chmod 644 *.php
chmod 644 .htaccess
```
