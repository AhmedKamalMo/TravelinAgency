# GoDaddy Deployment Instructions

## Quick Fix for 500 Error

1. **Upload Files**: Upload ALL contents of this 'godaddy-fixed' folder to your GoDaddy hosting root directory (public_html)

2. **File Permissions**: Set these permissions via cPanel File Manager:
   - Folders: 755
   - Files: 644
   - .htaccess: 644

3. **Test**: Visit https://worldtripagency.com/test.php to verify PHP is working

4. **Environment**: Rename .env.example to .env and update with your database credentials

## What This Fix Does:

- ✅ Corrected index.php to look in the right directories
- ✅ Added fallback paths for different deployment structures
- ✅ Included debug information to help troubleshoot
- ✅ Proper static file handling
- ✅ Correct MIME types and caching headers

## If Still Getting 500 Error:

1. Check error logs in cPanel
2. Verify .htaccess is uploaded and has correct permissions
3. Ensure all files are in the root directory (not in a subfolder)
4. Check that output/public/200.html exists

## File Structure Should Be:
public_html/
├── index.php (the corrected one)
├── .htaccess
├── test.php
├── output/
│   └── public/
│       ├── 200.html
│       ├── _nuxt/
│       └── images/
└── .env (rename from .env.example)

Your website should now work at: https://worldtripagency.com/
