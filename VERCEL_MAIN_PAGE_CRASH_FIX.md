# Vercel Main Page Crash Fix - Serverless Function Issue Resolved

## Problem Identified
The main page (`/`) was crashing with `FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED` because the `usePackages` composable was making API calls during server-side rendering (SSR), but the database wasn't configured.

## Root Cause
The `usePackages` composable in `composables/usePackages.ts` was calling `initializePackages()` on both server and client side:

```typescript
// PROBLEMATIC CODE (before fix)
if (process.client) {
  onMounted(initializePackages)
} else {
  // Server-side: Start fetching immediately
  initializePackages() // This was causing the crash
}
```

When `initializePackages()` ran on the server, it tried to fetch from `/api/packages`, which failed because:
1. No database connection was configured
2. Environment variables were missing
3. The API call failed and crashed the entire page

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed usePackages Composable
Modified `composables/usePackages.ts` to only fetch data on the client-side:

```typescript
// FIXED CODE
if (process.client) {
  onMounted(initializePackages)
} else {
  // Server-side: Set pending to false and use empty array
  pending.value = false
  packages.value = []
}
```

### 2. Added Debug Endpoints
Created two debug endpoints to help diagnose issues:
- `/api/test` - Basic API test (no database required)
- `/api/debug` - Detailed environment and database status

## What This Fixes

✅ **Main page loads successfully** - No more serverless function crashes
✅ **Graceful fallback** - Shows empty state until data loads on client
✅ **Better error handling** - Components handle missing data gracefully
✅ **Debug capabilities** - Can diagnose issues with debug endpoints

## Current Status

The website should now load successfully at `https://travelin-agency.vercel.app/` with:
- Hero section displaying properly
- Services section working
- Destinations sections working (using static data)
- Featured packages section showing "no packages available" until database is configured

## Next Steps

### 1. Deploy the Fix
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix main page crash by preventing SSR API calls in usePackages"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Test the Website
After deployment, test:
- Main page: `https://travelin-agency.vercel.app/`
- Debug endpoint: `https://travelin-agency.vercel.app/api/debug`
- Test endpoint: `https://travelin-agency.vercel.app/api/test`

### 3. Set Up Database (Optional)
To enable full functionality:
1. Set up a database (PlanetScale recommended)
2. Configure environment variables in Vercel
3. Packages will then load dynamically

## Technical Details

### Why This Approach Works
1. **SSR Safety**: No API calls during server-side rendering
2. **Client Hydration**: Data loads after the page is rendered
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Shows empty state until data loads
4. **Performance**: Page loads immediately, data loads in background

### Components Affected
- `components/HomeSections/featuredPackages.vue` - Now shows empty state until packages load
- `composables/usePackages.ts` - Fixed to prevent SSR API calls

### Other Components Status
- `components/HomeSections/servicesSection.vue` - ✅ Working (static data)
- `components/HomeSections/globalDestinations.vue` - ✅ Working (static data)
- `components/HomeSections/saudiDestinations.vue` - ✅ Working (static data)
- `components/HomeSections/HeroSection.vue` - ✅ Working (static data)

## Monitoring

After deployment, monitor:
1. Main page loads without errors
2. Debug endpoint shows environment status
3. Packages section shows appropriate empty state
4. No more `FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED` errors

The fix ensures the website is functional even without a database, while maintaining the ability to load dynamic data when a database is configured.
