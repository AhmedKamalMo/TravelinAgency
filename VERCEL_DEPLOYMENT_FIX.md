# Vercel Deployment Fix - Config File Issue Resolved

## Problem Fixed
The deployment was failing with the error:
```
Error: Config file was not found at "/vercel/path0/.vercel/output/config.json"
```

## Root Cause
The `.vercel/output` directory was missing the required `config.json` file that Vercel expects for Nuxt 3 deployments.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated `vercel.json`
- Added proper version specification (`"version": 3`)
- Added explicit build and output directory configuration
- Added proper routing configuration for API and static files
- Maintained existing function timeout settings

### 2. Regenerated Output Directory
- Cleaned the existing `.vercel/output` directory
- Ran `npm run build` to regenerate the proper structure
- The build process automatically created the correct `config.json` file

### 3. Verified Configuration
- The generated `config.json` includes proper routing rules
- API routes are configured with no-cache headers
- Static assets have proper caching headers
- Sitemap routes are properly configured

## Current Status
✅ **FIXED** - The deployment configuration is now properly set up

## Next Steps for Deployment

### 1. Commit and Push Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Vercel deployment configuration"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Environment Variables Setup
Make sure these environment variables are set in your Vercel project:

#### Required Database Configuration
```
DB_HOST=your-mysql-host
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USER=your-database-user
DB_PASSWORD=your-database-password
DB_NAME=your-database-name
```

#### Required JWT Configuration
```
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production
```

#### Required Site Configuration
```
PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://travelin-agency.vercel.app
NODE_ENV=production
```

#### Optional Twilio Configuration (for WhatsApp notifications)
```
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=your_twilio_phone_number
SALES_MANAGER_PHONE=your_sales_manager_phone
```

### 3. Database Setup
Since Vercel doesn't provide MySQL hosting, you'll need an external database:

**Recommended Options:**
- **PlanetScale** (MySQL-compatible, serverless) - Best for Vercel
- **Railway** (MySQL hosting)
- **AWS RDS** (MySQL hosting)
- **DigitalOcean Managed Database**

### 4. Deploy to Vercel
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to Settings → Environment Variables
4. Add all required environment variables
5. Redeploy your project

## Files Modified
- `vercel.json` - Updated with proper Nuxt 3 configuration
- `.vercel/output/config.json` - Generated automatically by build process

## Testing Your Deployment
After deployment, test these endpoints:
1. **Basic Function Test**: `https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/test`
2. **Health Check**: `https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/health`
3. **Database Test**: `https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/packages`

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues:
1. Check that all environment variables are set correctly
2. Verify your database connection
3. Check the Vercel function logs for any runtime errors
4. Ensure your MySQL database is accessible from Vercel's servers

## Performance Notes
- Static assets are served from `.output/public`
- API routes run as serverless functions
- Images are optimized through Nuxt Image
- Gzip and Brotli compression are enabled
- Proper caching headers are set for static assets

The deployment should now work correctly with the proper configuration files in place.
